VOLUME 2 – LINUX BASICS & COMMAND MASTERY
========================

CHAPTER 4 – WHY LINUX IS A HACKER’S BEST FRIEND
-----------------------------------------------
If Windows is like a fancy restaurant menu, Linux is like the kitchen. You get behind the scenes, control everything, and cook your own recipes (commands).

WHY HACKERS LOVE LINUX:
- Open Source: You can see and modify the code.
- Powerful Terminal: Commands can automate almost anything.
- Lightweight: Can run on old or small systems.
- Networking Tools: Preloaded with tools like nmap, netcat, tcpdump.

COMMON LINUX DISTROS FOR HACKING:
- Kali Linux: Comes with 600+ pre-installed hacking tools.
- Parrot OS: Lightweight and privacy-focused.
- BlackArch: For hardcore pentesters with 2000+ tools.

CHAPTER 5 – LINUX BASICS YOU MUST MASTER
----------------------------------------
FILE SYSTEM STRUCTURE:
- `/` – Root directory (the top of the tree).
- `/home` – Personal files for each user.
- `/etc` – Configuration files.
- `/var` – Logs and variable data.
- `/bin` – Basic commands and programs.

BASIC TERMINAL COMMANDS:
- `pwd` – Print current directory.
- `ls` – List files in the directory.
- `cd foldername` – Change directory.
- `mkdir foldername` – Create a folder.
- `rm filename` – Remove a file.
- `cp file1 file2` – Copy file1 to file2.
- `mv old new` – Move or rename files.
- `cat file` – Show file contents.
- `nano file` – Edit file in terminal.

CHAPTER 6 – INTERMEDIATE LINUX COMMANDS
---------------------------------------
- `chmod 755 file` – Change file permissions.
- `chown user:group file` – Change file ownership.
- `find / -name file.txt` – Search for a file.
- `grep 'word' file` – Search for a word inside a file.
- `ps aux` – Show running processes.
- `kill PID` – Stop a process using its process ID.
- `tar -cvf archive.tar files` – Create a tar archive.
- `tar -xvf archive.tar` – Extract a tar archive.
- `scp file user@ip:/path` – Securely copy file to another computer.

CHAPTER 7 – ADVANCED COMMANDS FOR HACKERS
-----------------------------------------
- `nmap IP` – Scan a target’s open ports and services.
- `netstat -tulpn` – Show all active network connections.
- `tcpdump` – Capture and analyze network packets.
- `hydra -l user -P passlist.txt target ssh` – Brute force SSH login.
- `airmon-ng` – Enable monitor mode for Wi-Fi hacking.
- `aircrack-ng capture.cap -w wordlist.txt` – Crack Wi-Fi passwords.
- `msfconsole` – Start the Metasploit framework for exploitation.
- `john hash.txt` – Crack password hashes with John the Ripper.

HACKER TIP:
Always use `man command` to learn more about any Linux command. Example: `man nmap` gives full usage details.

REAL-LIFE HACK EXAMPLE:
Imagine you’re investigating a suspicious device on your network.
1. Use `nmap` to find its open ports.
2. Use `netcat` to interact with those ports.
3. If it’s a camera, you might find a web login with default credentials.

FUNNY ANALOGY:
Linux is like having superpowers – but without the manual, you might accidentally blow up your own lair.
